<!-- Coordinate System
The actual value of coords is totally dependent on the shape in question. Here is a summary, to be followed by detailed examples âˆ’

rect = x1 , y1 , x2 , y2

x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle; x2 and y2 are the coordinates of the lower right corner.

circle = xc , yc , radius

xc and yc are the coordinates of the center of the circle, and radius is the circle's radius. A circle centered at 200,50 with a radius of 25 would have the attribute coords = "200,50,25"

poly = x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , x3 , y3 , ... xn , yn

The various x-y pairs define vertices (points) of the polygon, with a "line" being drawn from one point to the next point. A diamond-shaped polygon with its top point at 20,20 and 40 pixels across at its widest points would have the attribute coords = "20,20,40,40,20,60,0,40".

All coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the image (0,0). Each shape has a related URL. You can use any image software to know the coordinates of different positions. -->
